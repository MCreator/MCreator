If you're struggling with your Forge on MacOS/Windows when directly running a copy from MCreator, you may have to disable the early loading screen.

You CAN search up how to fix this... but that's for the MC launcher/other launchers that support JVM arguments.

Anyways, let's start.

# Starting

First copy this line of code at the end of the sentence since it is VERY important! `jvmArgs "-Dfml.earlyprogresswindow=false"`

Now, open the MCreator Workspace File Explorer (or the MCWFE/WFE) which can be found by pressing the arrow to the left of the workspace button. It will then open up this window:

# Opening `build.gradle`

Now, double-click on `build.gradle`! You should see all this code:

You'll need to go down to Line 28, put in a space and then paste that line of code you copied.

# Pasting the Line

It should look like this:

# Compiling

Now, close `build.gradle` and press CMD + B or CTRL + B or press the Hammer button to Build the mod/Save the files and compile.

Hit run and have fun :)
