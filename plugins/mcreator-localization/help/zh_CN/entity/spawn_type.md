该参数控制生物将会属于什么生成类型。

* 标记为“怪物”（Monster）的生物只会在黑暗处或晚上生成。
* A mob marked as Creature will spawn under direct sunlight on grass material blocks only. Do not use this spawn type with mob type living entities as they will not spawn
* A mob marked as Ambient will spawn under any conditions except if block type prevents it, but this category should be used for mobs with no gameplay effect such as bats
* WaterCreature will spawn in water, but with no other limitations
