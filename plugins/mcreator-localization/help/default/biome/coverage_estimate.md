This field provides an estimate of how much of the overworld surface would be 
covered by this biome. Only works properly if values for biomes are between -1 and 1 as this
is the range overworld biomes use.

In case your biome is used in Nether or in Overworld caves, this estimation
is not valid.

When using biomes in custom dimensions, coverage depends on the amount of biomes
your dimension has, and biome generation parameters of biomes in the dimension.
