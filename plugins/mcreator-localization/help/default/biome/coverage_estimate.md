This field provides an estimate of how much of the Overworld surface would be
covered by this biome. Only works properly if values for biomes are between -1 and 1 as this
is the range Overworld biomes use.

In case your biome is used in Nether or in Overworld caves, this estimation
is not valid.

When using biomes in a custom dimension, coverage depends on the amount of biomes
that dimension has, and biome generation parameters of biomes in the dimension.
