Erosion controls how eroded the terrain is. Smaller values describe biomes that
usually generate in flatter world regions.

Biomes with similar erosion will generate closer together
and will compete for the same spot in the world when generating.
Too similar values will result in some biomes not generating.

While values from -2 to 2 are valid, vanilla biomes only use values in range
from -1 to 1.

Various Overworld vanilla biomes use these value ranges:

* -1.0 to -0.78
* -0.78 to -0.375
* -0.375 to -0.2225
* -0.2225 to 0.05
* 0.05 to 0.45
* 0.45 to 0.5
* 0.55 to 1.0
