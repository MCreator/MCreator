Erosion

* Controls in which kind of terrain the biome spawns. Higher values mean flatter areas, lower values mean more hilly areas.


* Example:
  * Snowy slopes biome generates from -1 to -0.7999
  * Plains biome generates from -0.7999 to -0.375 (that is why it is so hilly ingame)
  * Swamp biome generates from 0.55 to 1
  
    
* First value must be lower than second one
