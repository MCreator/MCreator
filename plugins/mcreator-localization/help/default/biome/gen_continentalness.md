Continentalness controls how far the biome is from the coast.
Smaller values mean biomes closer to the coast and higher values mean biomes
further from the coast and with higher height (e.g. mountains).

Biomes with similar continentalness will generate closer together
and will compete for the same spot in the world when generating.
