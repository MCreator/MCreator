This parameter controls biome generation and not the climate.

Biomes with similar humidity will generate closer together
and will compete for the same spot in the world when generating.
Too similar values will result in some biomes not generating.

While values from -2 to 2 are valid, vanilla biomes only use values in range
from -1 to 1.

Various Overworld vanilla biomes use these value ranges:

* -1.0 to -0.35
* -0.35 to -0.1
* -0.1 to 0.1
* 0.1 to 0.3
* 0.3 to 1.0
