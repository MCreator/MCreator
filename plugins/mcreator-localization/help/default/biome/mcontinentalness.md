* Controls how close to coast the biomes are.


* Example: 
        
  * Deep ocean biomes generate from -1.05 to -0.455
  * Ocean biomes generate from -0.455 to -0.19
  * Forest biome generates from -0.11 to 0.3
  * Mountain peak biomes generate from 0.03 to 1


* First value must be lower than second one
