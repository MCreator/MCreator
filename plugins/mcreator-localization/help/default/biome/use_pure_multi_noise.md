Multi-noise dictates how biomes are placed.


If this is turned off:
* Mcreator uses it's own formulas to create multi-noise values for you, however, they may be hard to work with

If this is turned on:

* Manipulate the multi-noise biomes freely without a need to lock the mod element.
* With some basic knowledge a lot easier to manipulate.
