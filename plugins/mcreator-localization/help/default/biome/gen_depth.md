Depth parameter approximately controls the height at which the biome will be generated.
Only applies to (overworld) cave biomes and to custom dimensions where this biome
is specified as a cave biome.

For surface biomes, a depth value of 0 is always used, and this parameter is ignored.

Vanilla cave biomes use those values:

* 0.2-0.9 - Dripstone Caves, Lush Caves
* 1.1 - Deep Dark
