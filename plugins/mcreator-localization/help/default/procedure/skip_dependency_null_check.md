If this option is enabled, the procedure will be executed even if one of the dependencies is null.
Null checks should be inserted manually inside the procedure. This can be done using the null comparison procedure
block, found in the "Advanced" tab.

**Unchecked null values can crash the game**, so this option should be disabled in most cases.
