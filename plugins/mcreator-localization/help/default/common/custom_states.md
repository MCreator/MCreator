Here you can list additional properties of this ${elementtype?lower_case} and specify how its visual look changes
depending on given combination of properties' values that form a state.

NOTE: Duplicate states are not allowed. If two or more states only differ in value of single property, then removing
that property will automatically remove duplicates of first of these states.
