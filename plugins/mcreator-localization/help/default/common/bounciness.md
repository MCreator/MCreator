Determines the bounciness of a block (like vanilla Slime Block).
The block must have collisions enabled and be solid for bounciness to work.

* Default value of 0 disables bounciness
* 1 replicates vanilla Slime Block
* 0.66 replicates vanilla Beds

Note: this option does not prevent fall damage, so while bouncing, damage will still be applied.
Use fall damage induced parameter to reduce fall damage if needed.
