Select this parameter to disable the effect of gravity on this projectile.

You probably don't want this parameter in most cases as it makes projectile behave in non-realistic way.
A better option is to set a very high projectile power.

This means that the projectile will not fall to the ground and will move in a straight line until it hits something or is despawned.

Keep in mind if shot vertically, the projectile will not fall back down and will keep moving in the same direction.
