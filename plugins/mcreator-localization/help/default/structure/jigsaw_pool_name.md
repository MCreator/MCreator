This parameter controls the name of this jigsaw pool that might be used by the current one as a fallback in cases it can not be generated in the specified position.

If "Target pool" of jigsaw blocks in your parts is set to `${modid}:${registryname}_<pool_name>`, the game will place parts from this pool against them.
