This parameter controls how the terrain adapts to the structure.

* **none** - No effect on the terrain.
* **beard_thin** - Adds terrain below the structure and removes inside the structure. This is what villages use.
* **beard_box** - Stronger version of beard_thin. This is what ancient cities use.
* **bury** - Adds terrain completely around the structure. This is what strongholds use.
