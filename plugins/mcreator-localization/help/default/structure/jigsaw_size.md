This parameter defines how many jigsaw part structures can be generated connected 
to each other and to the main structure.

Using a fallback pool allows to place one more jigsaw part to complete the structure 
in the specified position.

In Minecraft 1.20.1 and earlier, the maximum value is 7. Larger values will be truncated.
