When enabled, the textures selected here will be rendered above the sun and moon.
If a custom skybox is enabled, these will be the only sun and moon visible in the sky.
The moon texture will need to follow the same texture format as the vanilla moon with all its
phases in order to render correctly. The sun texture does not have any requirements.
