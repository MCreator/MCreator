The generation shape allows changing how the block is generated depending on the height of the block.

* **Uniform**: This is a simple rectangle. This was the shape used before Minecraft 1.18.
* **Triangle**: This shape will make generate the block like a triangle. The layer with the most chance 
  to get this block will be the middle of the minimal and maximal height. Keep in mind that the maximal and minimal 
  generation heights can be above and below world limits.

NOTE: Only available in Minecraft 1.18.x and higher
