Here you can list additional custom properties of this block.
Block properties define basic possible states of the block.

The more property combinations possible, the slower the game will load and operate.
If you need to define a lot of states, consider using NBT data instead.

Some properties are used internally (for block rotation, waterlogging, and block bases), 
so their names can not be used.
