The block used as working block by the villagers of this profession.

If two mods define the same profession block, or another mod uses POI with this block for
some other feature, the profession will not work. For this reason, it is recommended
to double-check the block used is unique.

Try to avoid using blocks that are placed commonly by the worldgen or blocks that
are placed in early world generation, as this can cause a lot of warnings to be 
logged and can cause severe performance issues.

Examples of such blocks are air, dirt, stone, grass, custom biome blocks, etc.
