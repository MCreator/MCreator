When checked, this animation is not meant to be "action" animation, but rather
default walking animation bound to the walk controller of the entity.

The keyframe progression is controlled by the vanilla walk controller of the 
selected entity type.

You can still apply additional condition to the animation that controls when the animation is applied.
