This message is displayed in chat when a player dies from damage of this type, in most situations.

You can use the following tokens in the message:

- `<player>`: the name of the player who died
- `<attacker>`: the name of the entity that dealt the damage

NOTE: Use the second token only if the damage is always caused by a mob.
