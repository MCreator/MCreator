This parameter determines if the damage dealt should increase with difficulty.

- `Never`: difficulty doesn't affect the damage dealt
- `Always`: difficulty always increases the damage dealt, regardless of the source
- `When caused by living non player`: difficulty increases the damage dealt only if it's caused by a living entity 
(such as zombies or spiders)
