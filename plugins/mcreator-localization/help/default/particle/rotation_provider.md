This parameter overrides default particle billboarding (always appears to face player)

Specify the direction (in radians) in which the particles faces by passing a _'`vector`'_ with 3 parameters,\
where: `vec(pitch, yaw, roll)`
- (first entry provides pitch, second one provides yaw, third gives roll)

Note: When rendering, the rotations are applied in the order: (pitch-yaw-roll)
