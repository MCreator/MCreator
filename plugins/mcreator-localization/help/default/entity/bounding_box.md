This parameter controls the size of your mob's hitbox in blocks, as well as the size of its shadow.

The first option sets the width and depth, whilst the second option sets the height.

The third option sets size in blocks for the radius of the mob's shadow.

The fourth option sets the Y offset of the passenger's attachment point on the entity it's riding (this entity).
In other words, this parameter defines where another entity will be attached to this entity when riding it.
 
You can get more details on the entity model size [here](https://mcreator.net/wiki/entity-model-sizes).
