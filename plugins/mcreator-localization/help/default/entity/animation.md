With this parameter, you specify the animation that should be played.

Animations work with any model, but only models that have parts named the same
as the parts in the animation will be animated.

If model already has basic animations specified at the model level,
these animations will be applied **after** all the animations here are applied.
We recommend only using one or another animation system, not both for the same model.
