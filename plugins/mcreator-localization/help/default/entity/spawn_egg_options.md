If this parameter is checked, a spawn egg item is generated.

If you specify a custom texture, the spawn egg color parameter is ignored.

If no texture is specified, the egg texture will be autogenerated and colored with the specified colors.
The first color is the background of the egg.
The second color represents the dots on the egg.

You can choose the creative tab for the spawn egg here too.
