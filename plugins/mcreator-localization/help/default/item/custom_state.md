Specify values to be accepted by properties of your item for this state. If you uncheck the box on the left of a
property, it will not affect this state in any way.

Along with custom ones, you can also use built-in item properties:

* `damaged`: Returns 1.0 if the item is damaged and 0.0 otherwise;
* `damage`: Returns the total damage caused to the item (between 0.0 and 1.0);
* `lefthanded`: Returns 1.0 if the item is held in left hand of an entity and 0.0 otherwise;
* `cooldown`: Returns the remaining item cooldown time (between 0.0 and 1.0);
* `trim_type`: Returns fractional "ID" of armor trim type applied to the item (between 0.0 and 1.0).
