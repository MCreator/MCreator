Here you can specify animations that this item can play and the conditions when animations happen.

**Make sure that animations you use only reference model parts/bones that are present in the model file.
Otherwise, the model may fail to load or the game may crash.**

Animations will only play for the default item model and not for the models from the item states.

Existing model animations specified in the model file or during model file import will also
play alongside animations specified here.
