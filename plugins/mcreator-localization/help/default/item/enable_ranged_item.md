By enabling this parameter, the item will become a ranged item 
allowing it to shoot a projectile, like bows and crossbows.

For ranged item to work, set the animation to bow or similar
and make sure to use a non-zero value for the item use duration.

If you use the ranged item feature, the item will only shoot
if the required item (ammo) is in the player's inventory. This
is arrows when using vanilla arrows, or the item specified in
the required item parameter of a custom projectile.

If you want to shoot a projectile without the required item system,
use the right click procedure trigger and procedures to shoot it.
