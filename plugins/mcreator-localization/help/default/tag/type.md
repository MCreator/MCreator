* **Items:** use this to group multiple items together for recipes, procedures and other purposes.
* **Blocks:** only use the block type if you are targeting a block (_these tags can not be used in recipes_,
in most cases, you want to use Items tag group; one use case for this tag type is tagging custom log blocks in 
logs tag group so custom logs work with leaves decay mechanic).
* **Entities:** used for tagging entities together; for example, all entities tagged under "skeletons" namespace can kill creepers with music discs dropped.
* **Functions:** this is used for tagging functions into groups. 
One such group is called "tick" from the "minecraft" namespace. 
Functions tagged under the "tick" namespace will be executed each game tick.
