This value will be multiplied with the level of the enchantment (that the item has currently) 
to get the number of damage your enchantment will protect or add.
negative number is the damage add.

For example, PROTECTION has a value of 1, so for the first level, the enchantment will 
protect the player of 1 damage as 1 (level) * 1 (your value) = 1.

For example, Sharpness has a value of -1, so for the first level, the enchantment will
enchant the player of 1 damage as 1 (level) * 1 (your value) = 1.
