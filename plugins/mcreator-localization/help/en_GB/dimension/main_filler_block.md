The main block of the dimension like the Stone for the Overworld.

Avoid using complex blocks such as:

* transparent blocks
* blocks that are not full cube
* blocks with tile entity, NBT tags, or inventory
* blocks that are used as POI
* blocks that tick

If you use such blocks, the worldgen will be slow and the loaded world may lag severely.
