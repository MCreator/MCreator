Use this for copy+paste base for 1.20.x generator.

How to port:

* Cut files from reference folder and paste them into the generator.
* This folder is copy of 1.19.4 generator and is used to easier track what changed and what
  just needs a copy+paste

IMPORTANT: Make sure to sync files here if any changes to 1.19.4 generator are made so
the latest base is used for 1.20.x generator. If file is not synced with lates changes from 1.19.4
generator, make one commit syncing the file to the ref folder and then another commit for 
actual file move + port.
